# Coding Roadmap 🔧

This repository contains my progression through a 5-stage coding roadmap.
Each stage builds on the previous with increasing difficulty.

## 🚀 Stages
1. Foundations
2. Data Structures & Algorithms
3. Problem Solving & CS Challenges
4. Full Stack Development
5. Physics, Maths & Data

Each project folder includes:
- Description
- Requirements
- My approach
- Code
- Improvements I could make next time

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
"Completed, not perfect." The goal is iteration and skill growth.
